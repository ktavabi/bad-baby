This study was funded by funding from [Simms
Mann](https://www.simmsmanninstitute.org) and [Bezos Family
Foundation](https://www.bezosfamilyfoundation.org).

* `run_mnefun` to wrap around fancy `mne-tools` dense-array MEEG proccessing tools to denoise raw data across three auditory stimulation blocks:
  1. _AM steady state tone:_ sinusoidal 1 Khz carrier with 40Hz amplitude modulations at 80% mod depth.
  2. _double oddball:_ double oddball consonant-vowel syllabic segments with categorically differentiable VOT.
  3. _infant directed speech narrative:_ short bedtime story recording.
