# Magnetoencephalography (MEG) examination of auditory speech processing in infancy

This study was funded by private philantropic patronage from [Simms Mann]() and [Bezos Family Foundation]().

The default `master` branch is a dummy stem for individual experimetnal paradigms deployed:

1. Auditory oddball [mismatch](https://github.com/ktavabi/badbaby/tree/dataset-mmn) activity following phonological voice-onset timing (VOT) manipulation(s).
2. Auditory Steady State Response [(ASSR)](https://github.com/ktavabi/badbaby/tree/dataset-tone).
3. Auditory [speech tracking](https://github.com/ktavabi/badbaby/tree/dataset-mmn) by syllable rate entrainment.
