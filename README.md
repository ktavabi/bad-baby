This study was funded by funding from [Simms
Mann](https://www.simmsmanninstitute.org) and [Bezos Family
Foundation](https://www.bezosfamilyfoundation.org).

* `run_mnefun` wrappers for `mne-tools` MEEG proccessing tools to denoise raw data across three auditory stimulation blocks:

  1. _Tone:_ sinusoidal 1 Khz carrier signal with 40Hz amplitude modulations at 80% modulation depth.
  2. _MMN:_ double oddball syllabic segments with categorically differentiable VOT.
  3. _IDS:_ short infant directed speech narrative.
