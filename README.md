This study was funded by philanthropic funding from [Simms Mann](https://www.simmsmanninstitute.org) and [Bezos Family Foundation](https://www.bezosfamilyfoundation.org).

## The paradigms

### Oddball

[Here](https://github.com/ktavabi/badbaby/tree/dataset-mmn) I used consonant-vowel syllable stimuli used in an double-oddball [1] paradigm to examine the patterning of auditory evoked activity following changes in phonological voice-onset-timing [2] contrasts in young infants.

To process and generate manuscript figures you can run the following scripts on the raw MEG data from each paradigm.
