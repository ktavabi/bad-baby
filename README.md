## Branches

1. [_dataset-mmn_](https://github.com/ktavabi/badbaby/tree/dataset-mmn) consonant-vowel syllable stimuli were used in a double-oddball [1] paradigm to examine the scalp topography of auditory evoked response to phonological voice-onset-timing [2] contrasts in young infants.
2. [_dataset-tone_](https://github.com/ktavabi/badbaby/tree/dataset-tone)
3. [_dataset-ids_](https://github.com/ktavabi/badbaby/tree/dataset-mmn)
